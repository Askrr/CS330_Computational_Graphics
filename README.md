# CS330_Computational_Graphics

How do I approach designing software?
Requirements Gathering: Understand the problem you're solving and the requirements of your software.
Design: Create a high-level architecture, breaking down the software into modules or components.
Prototyping: Build a basic version of your software to validate design decisions and gather feedback.
Implementation: Write code based on your design.
Testing: Thoroughly test your software to identify and fix bugs.
Refinement: Iterate on your design and implementation based on testing results and user feedback.
Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation to aid users and future developers.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Creating a structured graphics pipeline, managing shaders, and organizing your codebase for efficient rendering.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Creating a wireframe or sketch of the scene, outlining the shaders and rendering techniques you planned to use, and deciding on the layout and placement of objects within the 3D space.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The design principles I applied in this project can be carried forward to future graphics programming endeavors, ensuring I have a solid foundation for designing and building interactive 3D environments.

How do I approach developing programs?
Writing code for rendering objects, handling user input (such as camera controls), managing shaders, and ensuring the 3D scene renders correctly.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Utilized techniques such as vertex buffering, shader programming, and OpenGL's API functions to create and manipulate the 3D environment.

How did iteration factor into your development?
It is essential for testing different rendering techniques, adjusting shader parameters, optimizing performance, and refining the visual aspects of your scene.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I became more adept at managing OpenGL resources efficiently, handling transformations, and improving rendering speed.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
It has provided me with practical experience in understanding and implementing concepts related to transformations, shaders, lighting, and texture mapping. These skills can be valuable in various fields, including computer graphics, game development, and simulations.
